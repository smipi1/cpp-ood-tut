[Object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_analysis_and_design) is a technical approach. It:
* is used to analyze and design an *application, system, or business*.
* applies [object-oriented programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) and *visual modeling*.
* guides stakeholder *communication* and product *quality*.

---

A [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(engineering)) is a series of *interrelated tasks* that transform *inputs* into *outputs*.

---

[Object-oriented design (OOD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_design) is the *process* of planning a *system of interacting objects* for the purpose of *solving a software problem*.

The **inputs** of OOD are the outputs of [object-oriented analysis (OOA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_analysis_and_design). Some examples of OOA outputs are:
* [Conceptual models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_model_(computer_science)),
* [Use cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case),
* [System sequence diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_sequence_diagram),
* [User interface documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface), and
* [Relational data models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_data_model).

The **output** (deliverables) of OOD are:
* [Sequence diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram) that extend the [System sequence diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_sequence_diagram), and
* [Class diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram)

[Object-oriented programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) is a [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) based on the concept of **objects**.

A [type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) is a collection of *operations* and *state*:
* The *state* remains hidden.
* All interactions are mediated by its *operations*.

An [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(object-oriented_programming)) similarly groups *methods* and *state*:
* The *state* is usually hidden and kept private.
* Interactions are mediated by its *methods*.

A [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)) is an extensible program-code-template for creating [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(object-oriented_programming))
